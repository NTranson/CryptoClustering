# CryptoClustering

The project involved creating two unsupervised learning models for cryptocurrency data. One model used all the features, while the other used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features. The goal was to find the optimal number of clusters (k) for each model using the elbow curve method and then fit the models to make predictions based on the optimal k value. The scaled data was used to find the best k value and fit the models for plotting. The models were then compared using elbow curves and scatter plots with clusters.
